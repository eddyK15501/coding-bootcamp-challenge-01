# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Description

In this weeks challenge, we were asked to refactor code to make the website more accessible. Located in the Assets folder is an image of what the final product should look like. Located in the Develop folder is the index.html, as well as the style.css file under assets.

The first changes made were in the title where the head tag is located, as well as in the HTML elements. Renaming the title of the website, along with switching the div containers into header, main, section, aside, and footer tags to give more semantics. 

Next up, adding alt tags to the images. This will help give a description to what the image is referencing, when being read by screen readers.

Finally, modifying the classes and id of certain HTML tags, and adjusting the CSS to make the website look more presentable.
